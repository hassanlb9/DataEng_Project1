# DataEng_Project1 - Web application Sentiment Analysis -

This project is for the course "Data Engineering II‚Äù, made by:

* Alain NGOMEDJ
* Emeric BERTIN
* BACHACHA Hassan

## Introduction:

The goal of this project is to combine all the skills collected throughout the course thus far, and provide a solid example of real-life application development in a DevOps environment.

The application we've made is a sentiment analysis application, which, given a piece of text, should be able to reply with its sentiment as being positive, negative, or neutral.

* The text language used must be English
* The application should have a web interface with an input form and a submit button, where users can input their sentences, and hit submit, and the sentiment of their sentence will be presented.
* The accuracy of the sentiment analyzer should be above 80%
* The application must be easily deployable
